# How to Scroll to an Element in Playwright

In the dynamic landscape of web development, creating visually stunning and interactive websites has become a norm. However, this has led to the proliferation of content-rich pages that often extend beyond the viewport's confines. As a result, users often need to scroll to an element to access all the information available. 
The act of scrolling isn't just a technical necessity; it's a critical element that profoundly impacts user experience and site visits. 

Efficient scrolling enhances engagement, encourages content discovery, and can positively affect search engine rankings, leading to longer site visits and a more successful online presence. 

This repository contains code to demonstrate Vertical & Horizontal scrolling using Python Playwright.
